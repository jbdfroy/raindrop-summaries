        <p>Title: A Shift in Trade Policy: Moving Away from Rules-Based Global Trade</p>
<p>The U.S. President Donald Trump&rsquo;s administration has been the most disruptive force in global trade since the 1930s, challenging the post–Cold War trade order that sought to establish economic principles for participating governments. This disruption provides an opportunity to correct an overly rigid attitude towards trade that was established in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Prior to the 1990s, U.S. presidents generally supported free trade and encouraged other countries to lower trade barriers. However, they adopted a more pragmatic approach, using tools such as tariffs and export controls to protect American interests. This pragmatic approach is being revived by President Trump, who has broken away from the rules-based global trading order.</p>
<p>Trump does not seek to create new principles governing how countries can set tariffs. Instead, he uses tariff threats and strong-arm tactics to pressure countries such as Argentina and Guatemala to accept U.S. cars and pharmaceuticals. This antipathy towards a global trading order arises from Trump&rsquo;s personality but also reflects a more pragmatic approach that meets the current moment.</p>
<p>Neither of the factors that led to the rise of the rules-based trade order exist anymore. American economists and policymakers are no longer united on which economic policies are best, and disagreements simmer over how to regulate digital technology platforms, intellectual property laws, and antitrust issues. Even if the U.S. could set trade rules worldwide, many of the major challenges in today&rsquo;s global economy, such as China&rsquo;s enormous trade surpluses, are not ones that detailed rules are likely to solve.</p>
<p>Policymakers in Washington and allied capitals must return to a more flexible approach to trade. Elements of Trump&rsquo;s second-term trade deals show the benefits of a more pragmatic approach and should be expanded upon. Agreements with Cambodia, Malaysia, Argentina, and the United Kingdom include provisions that commit countries to cooperating with the U.S. on tariffs, export controls, sanctions, and screening investments for risks to U.S. national security. These provisions provide an important foundation for any future U.S. president to build upon in deals with other countries around the world.</p>
<p>The U.S. should also pursue deals that secure U.S. interests in key sectors such as critical minerals, which span many countries. Trump has already included critical minerals provisions in several trade deals, and these bilateral provisions should be expanded into sectorial trade deals with multiple relevant jurisdictions. Washington should work to tilt the playing field to its advantage over Beijing by negotiating agreements that limit China&rsquo;s trade surplus and provide flexibility for implementation.</p>
<p>Abandoning trade rules has also given Trump leeway to innovate new policy tools, such as convincing Japan and South Korea to set up state-backed investment funds to plow money into the U.S. These investments could boost growth in key U.S. sectors such as energy, manufacturing, and data centers.</p>
<p>In conclusion, Trump&rsquo;s trade policy represents a shift away from the rules-based global trading order that was established in the 1990s. While some of his policies are not pragmatic, especially his tariffs, there are benefits to a more pragmatic approach, which prioritizes flexibility and innovation over adherence to rigid principles. If Washington policymakers and U.S. trade partners recoil from the aspects of Trump&rsquo;s trade policy that reflect a well-considered and historically American pragmatism, they will miss a valuable opportunity for achieving global prosperity.</p>
