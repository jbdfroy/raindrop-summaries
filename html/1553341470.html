        <p><strong>Titre :</strong> &lsquo;Russia&rsquo;s Shadow Warfare Against Europe: A Growing Concern for NATO&rsquo;</p>
<h2 id="foreign-affairs-march-2026">Foreign Affairs (March 2026)</h2>
<p><strong>Article :</strong></p>
<p>Russia is waging a war that transcends borders, with Ukraine serving as the open front. The ultimate objective is to defeat a coalition of adversaries, including Europe and Russian opposition figures seeking refuge there. This has led Moscow to conduct repeated attacks on people and infrastructure within NATO&rsquo;s borders. These attacks, once referred to as &ldquo;hybrid operations&rdquo; or &ldquo;active measures,&rdquo; have evolved into overt kinetic assaults intended to degrade critical systems and Europe&rsquo;s willingness to fight.</p>
<p>The list of Russian shadow attacks in Europe has grown each month. Russian drone fleets have disrupted airports in several countries, forcing them to scramble their jets, damaged property in Poland, disrupted European railways and logistics depots with explosive devices planted by operatives, and disrupted vital energy and telecommunications links across the Baltic Sea using Russian-linked ships.</p>
<p>With each new act of shadow warfare, the risk of escalation grows. To prevent all-out war with Russia, the West must impose meaningful consequences. This requires a clearer consultation mechanism within NATO, increased cooperation between allies to identify attacks, and a clearer menu of responses, including intelligence and cyber operations, hair-trigger economic and political penalties, and limited but overt military measures when attacks endanger lives or critical systems.</p>
<p>The Kremlin sees itself at war with the West, not just over Ukraine but also over the survival of the Putin regime. Given that Russian President Vladimir Putin views the conflict as existential, Moscow does not compartmentalize its invasion of Ukraine from covert strikes on Europe and attacks on Russian dissidents abroad. In the Kremlin&rsquo;s view, these are three fronts in the same war.</p>
<p>Russia pursues shadow aggression because it fears all-out warfare against a more powerful adversary. Moscow knows that when kinetic attacks are carried out below the threshold of what European policymakers and publics usually consider to be war, it can exploit Western inertia and confusion. The West&rsquo;s responses almost always come late, weakening deterrence by severing the causal link between actions and consequences.</p>
<p>European responses have been weak, limited to rhetoric, sanctions, and visa restrictions that do little to dissuade Russia. Despite attempts to coordinate responses, incidents are often treated as problems best taken up by traditional law enforcement agencies rather than matters of collective or national defense. This approach has weakened deterrence by signaling European caution rather than determination.</p>
<p>To restore deterrence, the NATO alliance should agree to clear thresholds for Article 4 proceedings, ensure that consultations become the norm in response to shadow aggression, and work through both NATO and the European Commission to set up responses sufficient to dissuade or disrupt further attacks and degrade Russia&rsquo;s capabilities. When shadow attacks endanger lives or inflict major damage on critical infrastructure, proportionate military responses, including cyberattacks or kinetic strikes against Russian assets, must also be considered.</p>
<p>Effective strategic response also necessitates improved intelligence sharing to ensure swift detection and determination of shadow warfare attacks, with each member&rsquo;s national security apparatuses coordinating a response. Ensuring such coordination is all the more urgent now that Washington appears more ambivalent toward European security concerns.</p>
