        <p><strong>Titre :</strong> U.S. and Denmark Considering a Future Deal on Greenland after Trump&rsquo;s Surprising Announcement</p>
<h2 id="foreign-policy-february-2023">Foreign Policy (February 2023)</h2>
<p><strong>Article :</strong></p>
<p>Last week, U.S. President Donald Trump posted on social media that he and NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte had discussed a potential future deal with respect to Greenland. The announcement came unexpectedly, given Trump&rsquo;s recent threats of military seizure and tariffs against Europe over Greenland. However, at the Davos summit, Trump appeared to take military seizure off the table and put tariffs on hold after &ldquo;satisfactory&rdquo; talks with Rutte.</p>
<p>Little is yet known about this potential deal, but it is in the United States’ national interest to have a larger presence in Greenland, which is central to U.S. security in the Arctic and crucial for resources and trade. Denmark and Greenland also benefit from closer engagement with the United States due to their long-standing alliance and shared interests in ensuring Arctic security.</p>
<p>Competition is ramping up among major powers in the region, making a broader deal necessary to secure U.S. and European interests there. Trump will need to claim a &ldquo;win&rdquo; for the United States, while Denmark, Greenland, and other allies have an incentive to ensure he can do so without force.</p>
<p>However, such a deal requires finesse due to Trump&rsquo;s previous rhetoric about annexation. To succeed, he must immediately abandon his current rhetoric lest he turn Danes and Greenlanders against Americans for the foreseeable future. Denmark has made it clear that sovereignty over the island is non-negotiable, and recent surveys show that few Americans support a military takeover of Greenland.</p>
<p>Greenland is a linchpin to great powers’ efforts to build resilient industrial and technological supply chains, with significant deposits of crucial minerals. The United States already coordinates with North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) on joint military exercises in Greenland, and both Denmark and Greenland could be invited to join the organization.</p>
<p>The deal should go beyond military engagements and primarily focus on new investments and commercial initiatives, such as tourism, hospitality, fishing, and mining. Special import carve-outs for Danish and Greenlandic goods, maritime routes for commerce and tourism, specialized labor arrangements, and a dedicated work-visa category for U.S. personnel in Greenland could stimulate local wealth creation and economic interdependence between the United States and Greenland.</p>
<p>To accomplish all this, formal negotiation channels with Denmark and Greenland must be established. A high-level working group is a good start, but the group&rsquo;s mandate and members must be quickly agreed upon. The deal should also be negotiated in close coordination with NATO, potentially including an independent Arctic Command to coordinate activities in the region.</p>
<p>Political courage from Danish and Greenlandic leaders will be required to prioritize long-term national interests over short-term political interests. In return, the United States must transition away from inflammatory and incoherent rhetoric on Greenland.</p>
