        <p>Title: The Extractive Model of Industrial Policy: Trump&rsquo;s Misuse of Government Tools for Short-Term Gains</p>
<p>The article discusses the misuse of industrial policy instruments by the Trump administration, focusing on equity stakes, tariffs, and conditional investments. Instead of being employed as part of a coherent national economic strategy, these instruments are used primarily as vehicles for leverage and power projection, rather than creating long-term prosperity for the American people.</p>
<p>The article uses Intel as an example, pointing out that the government&rsquo;s investment in the company was not made because it had helped create Intel, but through converting CHIPS Act grants into equity stakes. The $5.7 billion investment comes with nonvoting shares, eliminating any meaningful oversight or strategic direction. This is characterized as retroactive value extraction from a company built by decades of public investment, without funding the next generation of innovation.</p>
<p>The article also criticizes Trump&rsquo;s use of tariffs, arguing that they often target goods the United States cannot readily produce at home, raising costs without creating capability. The Consumer Technology Association has estimated that smartphones would cost an additional $213 per device under Trump’s proposed tariffs on China.</p>
<p>The article further criticizes the administration&rsquo;s dismantling of American innovation, citing proposed funding rollbacks and staff reductions at research labs, universities, and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. The Defense Department&rsquo;s science and technology funding faces a proposed ten percent cut, despite calls for record increases in overall defense spending.</p>
<p>The article concludes by emphasizing that industrial policy can deliver for working class Americans, but only if contracts require that public investment translates into better wages and more affordable essentials, not just higher stock prices. The task is to make industrial strategy work for the American public by creating wealth through public investment guided by modern-day moonshots, setting clear public goals defined by the problem to be solved and the outcomes to be delivered. Enforceable terms are needed to lead to better wages, affordability, and returns that can be reinvested in future innovations, ensuring that when the government invests, the public shares in the upside.</p>
