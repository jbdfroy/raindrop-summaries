        <p><strong>Titre</strong> : The Historical Precedents and Misconceptions of U.S. President Donald Trump&rsquo;s National Security Policy
<strong>Source</strong> : Foreign Affairs (March/April 2023)
<strong>Article</strong> :</p>
<p>The argument that Donald Trump&rsquo;s leadership style is reminiscent of the isolationist ways of the nineteenth-century United States has some truth, but it overlooks crucial distinctions. The essence of Trump&rsquo;s national security policy does resemble early U.S. presidents such as James Monroe, Andrew Jackson, and Theodore Roosevelt in terms of maximizing American power. However, none of these presidents were true isolationists, and neither is Trump.</p>
<p>The United States has been an active player on the global stage since its inception. Its early military engagements included the quasi-war with France and its sponsored pirates from 1798 to 1800 and conflicts with Barbary pirates in the Mediterranean from 1801 to 1815. The country expanded its territorial borders throughout the nineteenth century, becoming increasingly active in the Pacific Ocean and Asia.</p>
<p>By the turn of the twentieth century, the United States was consciously entering the club of great powers, sizing its naval buildups by reference to other powers&rsquo; capabilities. This marked a shift towards a more expansive foreign and defense policy. U.S. involvement in Eurasian conflict is not a matter of simple preference but rather a historical reality.</p>
<p>During Trump&rsquo;s first term, there were indications that he might change the essence of U.S. grand strategy and defense to a form of minimalism. However, his second term has been characterized more by maximalism than any form of minimalism. His administration has brokered peace negotiations around the world, authorized the use of force against Iranian nuclear facilities and Venezuela&rsquo;s sitting president, and advocated for greater U.S. defense spending. Trump&rsquo;s actions dispel the notion that he is an isolationist.</p>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s philosophy centers on the pursuit of national power, but this simplistic approach can fail catastrophically if not leavened with a more inclusive vision that takes the legitimate interests of other countries into account. The history of the United States suggests that Trump is not nearly as unprecedented a figure in American history as is sometimes alleged.</p>
