        <p><strong>Title:</strong> Trump&rsquo;s Transformation of U.S.-Europe Relations: A Shift Towards Ideological Alliances (The Atlantic, January 2023)</p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> The Atlantic - January 2023</p>
<p><strong>Article:</strong></p>
<p>In the ten months since U.S. President Donald Trump returned to office, he has significantly altered the way the United States engages with allies and adversaries. Trump is not only revamping the White House&rsquo;s architecture and decoration; he is redrawing mental maps through which Washington sees the world.</p>
<p>Initially, the administration’s focus on tariffs suggested that Trump was uninterested in other countries&rsquo; politics and cared only about trade balances. However, recent moves have dispelled this illusion. Trump&rsquo;s hostility towards Brazil (whose leftist president he dislikes intensely) and financial generosity towards Argentina (whose right-wing populist president he has called his &ldquo;favorite president&rdquo;) are driven by ideology rather than economics.</p>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s policies are defined by a left-right divide, rather than the traditional divide between democracy and authoritarianism. Unlike predecessors such as Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama, and Joe Biden, Trump is not interested in exporting democracy. Instead, he aims to export his domestic political agenda—one that is anti-immigration, anti-woke, anti-green.</p>
<p>Perhaps nowhere has the primacy of ideology been more pronounced than in Trump’s approach to Europe. Heaping disdain on the European Union and shunning traditional liberal values, his administration has instead leaned into Europe’s far right. Trump has expressed admiration for Hungary&rsquo;s longtime prime minister, Viktor Orban, and has supported various far-right parties in Europe, such as Germany&rsquo;s Alternative für Deutschland (AfD).</p>
<p>However, Trump&rsquo;s European strategy may ultimately fail. Right-wing parties are aware that in an increasingly unstable geopolitical landscape, their countries may have to fend for themselves. Confronted with a hostile world, Europe’s right may rediscover the practicality of Europe’s decoupling from an unreliable United States. Ultimately, Trump&rsquo;s effect on Europe in many ways resembles Mikhail Gorbachev&rsquo;s effect on the Eastern bloc in the 1980s. Gorby-mania dramatically reshaped communist regimes of eastern Europe—and in the process helped Moscow lose its sphere of influence.</p>
