        <p>The text you provided discusses the potential return of energy weaponization as a result of geopolitical shifts and changes in the global energy market. Energy weaponization refers to countries using their control over energy resources, such as oil or gas, as a tool for political or economic leverage against other nations.</p>
<p>The text highlights several key factors that contribute to this potential return of energy weaponization:</p>
<ol>
<li>Great-power competition: Increased geopolitical rivalry between major powers can lead to the use of energy resources as a means to gain influence or achieve foreign policy goals.</li>
<li>Economic fragmentation: The retreat of globalization and increasing regional economic blocs could create more opportunities for countries to control and manipulate energy markets within their own spheres of influence.</li>
<li>Tightening energy markets: With growing demand for energy resources, particularly in emerging economies, the potential for market imbalances and price volatility increases, making energy a valuable tool for coercion.</li>
<li>Concentration of both fossil fuels and clean energy supplies: As some countries gain control over critical energy resources, they can use this leverage to exert influence or pressure on other nations.</li>
</ol>
<p>In response to these trends, the text suggests several policy actions that countries can take to protect themselves from energy weaponization:</p>
<ol>
<li>Reduce exposure to volatile energy supplies: By decreasing reliance on imported energy and increasing domestic production, countries can insulate themselves from market shocks and coercion.</li>
<li>Build up buffers against potential shocks: Creating emergency stockpiles of critical resources, such as oil or natural gas, can provide a buffer against supply disruptions.</li>
<li>Increase energy efficiency: Improving the efficiency of energy consumption can help reduce dependence on volatile markets and make countries less vulnerable to coercion.</li>
<li>Boost domestic supplies of clean energy: Investing in renewable energy sources like solar and wind power, as well as nuclear and other low-carbon technologies, can provide a more secure and less carbon-intensive energy mix.</li>
<li>Diversify energy supply chains: By investing in energy projects in diverse regions, countries can reduce their reliance on Chinese-dominated or otherwise monopolized supply chains.</li>
<li>Protect against cybersecurity threats: Hardening power grids and implementing better protections against cyberattacks can help make energy infrastructure more resilient to attacks.</li>
<li>Create emergency stockpiles of critical minerals: Just as with oil, creating strategic reserves of critical minerals can help cushion against future supply disruptions.</li>
</ol>
<p>In conclusion, the text argues that in a world where energy weaponization may once again become a potent tool for coercion, governments will need to invest heavily in more secure sources of energy and build redundant and resilient infrastructure to protect against potential energy crises. These investments can provide both increased energy security and a powerful push for clean energy deployment, making the pursuit of energy security and reduced fossil fuel use complementary goals.</p>
