        <p><strong>Titre :</strong> Donald Trump&rsquo;s National Security Strategy: A Focus on Personality, Power, and Prosperity</p>
<p><strong>Source :</strong> Foreign Affairs - November 2021</p>
<p><strong>Article :</strong></p>
<p>In his first term as U.S. president and on the campaign trail for reelection in 2024, Donald Trump&rsquo;s instincts have been apparent. These include an appreciation of power for its own sake, a view of prosperity as a fundamental organizing principle of foreign policy, and a close alignment of politics with personality.</p>
<p>Trump&rsquo;s new National Security Strategy, published late last week, synthesizes these three instincts, presenting them as the necessary drivers of international order. The strategy document emphasizes the character of the United States and entrusts its protection to Trump and his team, who have &ldquo;successfully marshaled America’s great strengths to correct course and begin ushering in a new golden age for our country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The strategy also represents American conservatism, with a focus on separating friends from foes, uniting domestic politics with foreign policy, and rejecting the Biden administration. It prioritizes civilizational principles &ldquo;in Europe, the Anglosphere, and the rest of the democratic world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>However, the strategy document mirrors and distorts international reality by privileging raw power over persuasion and focusing U.S. foreign policy primarily on the Western Hemisphere, despite the Indo-Pacific becoming the world&rsquo;s economic center of gravity. The strategy celebrates American power but also seeks to restrain U.S. ambitions, with a goal of creating a dense network of personal relationships that supersedes any alliances or divisions along democratic/authoritarian lines.</p>
<p>This network could benefit Russian President Vladimir Putin in ending the war in Ukraine on his terms and accommodate Chinese leader Xi Jinping&rsquo;s grandiose plans for China. It will also cater to Trump&rsquo;s visceral, personal approach to international relations, allowing him to quickly change views and commitments.</p>
<p>The strategy document is presentist, lacking a historical backdrop except allegations of pre-Trump dysfunction and admiring references to the Monroe Doctrine. The document is a security strategy for the age of social media, pegged to a never-ending, fluid, ever-adjustable present tense, complicating the practice of persuasion with empathy or attention to foreign countries.</p>
<p>Meaningful persuasion enshrines deference toward other countries when merited and requires the suspension of short-term interests for the sake of long-term interests. The strategy document often construes foreign policy as nothing more than naked assertiveness, a means to the end of &ldquo;an American-led world of sovereign countries and free economies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The strategy addresses Europe as a second-order consideration, with the Western Hemisphere enjoying pride of place due to perceived problems of illegal immigration and drug trafficking. The strategy risks militarizing problems that are not military in nature. The document&rsquo;s approach to the war in Ukraine is assertive, optimistic, and understates the conflict&rsquo;s stakes, potentially normalizing Russia&rsquo;s zeal to control Ukraine.</p>
<p>American presidents typically react to crises rather than dictating outcomes, making it unclear how Trump&rsquo;s second term will unfold, but the 2025 NSS outlines his desired approach to international relations.</p>
